# Detection and Prediction of Seizures in Patients with Epilepsy

Research Project 

Seizure Detection and Prediction
- Predicted and detected seizures in Kaggle Epilepsy dataset
- Utilized bench mark of ID3 (decision trees), KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors), and SVM (support vector machines)
- Utilized improved algorithms of CART (decision trees and random forest) and LVQ (learning vector quantiization)
